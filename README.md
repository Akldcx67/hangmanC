# hangmanC

Hello everyone, this is my very first little project on C. I will warn you right away that I did not write this code myself, I wrote it, this code came from one telegram channel about C and C++. But I'm only learning in C, so you shouldn't be so strict about it 

This is a gallows-in-the-terminal game. I wrote this on Linux, so I can't say for sure what will work on Windows. Probably, you will figure out how to play it yourself
